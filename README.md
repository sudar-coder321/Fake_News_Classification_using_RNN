# Fake News Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks

An Analysis Notebook for classifying fake news articles using recurrent convolutional neural networks. The dataset used for this project is the result of aggregating data from the datasets below:

- https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news
- https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/source-based-news-classification
- https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news

Note - Word Embeddings were taken from Tensorflow Word2Vec and a manual analysis was also done initially to check the count of words
